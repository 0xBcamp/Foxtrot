Experiment with web3 technology and investing using our Decentralized Application and existing educational platforms.

Quick Start:

All you need to begin your web3 journey with us is the following:

1. Internet Access

2.Laptop/Mobile Device

3.Google Play Store/ Apple Play Store


Why we created this project?:


The world financial markets have become more easily accessible than any other point in history and the rapid advancement of technology continues to change many lives especially through blockchain technology yet a large population of people are still not aware and experience economic inequality due to the lack of knowledge of financial instruments and the financial power of web3 as almost close to 2 billion workers alone are living in countries where inflation outpaces earnings and leads to a negative ripple effect of family communities suffering due to financial constraints.


Our Solution:

Foxtrot is a project that helps to close the financial knowledge gap by using a DaPP. Scaffold-Eth or existing solutions will be used to create a gamified learning experience where users are rewarded with crypto-tokens such as H20 at the end of their learning experience and in-game points and the user is in full control of their user experience from a wide category of financial instruments while learning the basic usage of Web3 wallets and how it works with already existing financial educational platforms and web3 investing.
